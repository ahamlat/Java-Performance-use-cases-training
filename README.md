# Java-Performance-use-cases-training

## Description
This project shows some performance optimizations on Java performance issues.

## Use cases

* I/O Buffers
* Maps in a concurrent context
* ForkjoinPool
* String concatenation
* Memory leak on a collection
* Memory leak due to an infinite loop
* Classloader leak
* CompletableFuture to optimize IO bound program
* CompletionService to optimize IO bound program

In the last case, CompletionService is an alternative to CompletableFuture if you still use Java 7.
